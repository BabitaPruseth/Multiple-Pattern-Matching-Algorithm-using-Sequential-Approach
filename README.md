# Multiple-Pattern-Matching-Algorithm-using-Sequential-Approach
A new DNA pattern matching algorithm has been developed named as “Multiple Pattern Matching Algorithm using Sequential Approach”, carried out during my M.Sc. dissertation work. As the importance of a pattern in a biological sequences is very well known. It is a small part inside a large sequence but it has the capacity to carry the full information about the sequence and responsible for the biological activities. Hence Pattern Matching algorithm is the stepwise procedure to find out the position and number of occurrences of a pattern in a large sequence. Here one new algorithm is developed called “Multiple Pattern Matching Algorithm using Sequential Approach”.
